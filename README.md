This is a POC (Proof of Concept) API developed on short notice (3â€“4 hours) to simulate sensor data coming from IoT devices,
and display their values on client pages in real time using Socket.io while
the client pages are protected by soft GUID-based secret locks.

It also includes:
* MongoDB as the database,
* Twig templating engine,
* JWT authentication,
* Api-Key authentication,
* Basic rate-limiting implementations,
* Logging middlewares,
* Enumeration classes to standardize HTTP result codes and improve readability
